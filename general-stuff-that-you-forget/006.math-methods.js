    Useful Math methods

    sqrt() -                                    Returns the square root of the passed number.
    Params - number

    max() -                                     Returns the largest of the zero or more numbers given as input
    Params - value0, value1, ...                parameters, or NaN if any parameter isn't a number and can't be
                                                converted into one.

    min() -                                     Returns the lowest-valued number passed into it, or NaN if any
    Params - value0, value1, ...                parameter isn't a number and can't be converted into one.


    random() -                                  Returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range 0 to less
                                                than 1 (inclusive of 0, but not 1)

    trunc() -                                   Returns the integer part of a number by removing any fractional digits.
    Params - number

    round() -                                   Returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer.
    Params - number                             It performs type coercion.

    ceil() -                                    Always rounds a number up to the next largest integer. It performs
    Params - number                             type coercion

    floor() -                                   Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.
    Params - number                             It performs type coercion.
