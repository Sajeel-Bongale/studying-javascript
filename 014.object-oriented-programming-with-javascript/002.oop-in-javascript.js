    A class is like a blueprint which can be used to create instances.
    This process of creating objects is called instantiation.

    How does OOP work in Javascript?
    In javascript there is a concept called prototype and all objects in JS are linked to a
    certain prototype object.

    Each object has a prototype.

    The prototype object contains properties and methods that each object of that class can use and access.
    This is called prototypal inheritance.

    The inheritance is also called delegation in JS.

    The 3 ways of implementing prototypal inheritance are:
    1. Constructor functions
    2. ES6 Classes
    3. Object.create()

    Objects inherit properties and methods from the prototype.
