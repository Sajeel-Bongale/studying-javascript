    What is object oriented programming (OOP)?
    OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.

    Objects are used to model real world features like user

    Objects contain data(properties) and code(methods)

    In OOP objects are self contained pieces of code that are building blocks for applications and
    they interact with each other.

    Interactions such as these happen through a public interface(API): methods that the code
    outside of the object can access and use to communicate with the object.

    In traditional OOP we use classes to create objects. Classes are like blueprints which are used
    to generate objects of that type. It is like a set of rules which are abstract.

    All objects created using classes are called instances of that class.

    The class itself is not an object.

    The 4 fundamental principles of OOP are Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

    Abstraction means to ignore or to hide details that don't matter. This allows us to get an overview perspective
    of whatever it is that we're implementing instead of messing with details that don't really matter to our
    implementation.

    Encapsulation means keeping some properties and method private inside the class so they are not accessible from
    outside the class. Some methods can be exposed as a public interface(API).

    Inheritance makes all properties and methods of a class to all child classes. It thus, creates a hierarchical
    relationship between classes. This allows us to reuse common logic.

    Polymorphism means a child class can overwrite a method inherited from a parent class.

    Note: Javascript does not support real classes. It does have the syntax that looks like it is creating
    real classes, however that is not the case.
